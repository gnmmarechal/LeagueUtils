Even in the shadows of the mountains north of Noxus, she is a magical outlier. Her natural affinity for fire manifested early in life through unpredictable, emotional outbursts, though she eventually learned to control these \u00e2\u20ac\u0153playful tricks.\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd Her favorite includes the summoning of her beloved teddy bear, Tibbers, as a fiery protector. Lost in the perpetual innocence of childhood, Annie wanders the dark forests, always looking for someone to play with.--detChampOlaf;.-.;Olaf;.-.;2;.-.;[Ljava.lang.String;@52aa2946;.-.;the Berserker;.-.;An unstoppable force of destruction, the axe-wielding Olaf wants nothing but to die in glorious combat. Hailing from the brutal Freljordian peninsula of Lokfar, he once received a prophecy foretelling his peaceful passing\u00e2\u20ac\u201da coward's fate, and a great insult among his people. Seeking death, and fueled by rage, he rampaged across the land, slaughtering scores of great warriors and legendary beasts in search of any opponent who could stop him. Now a brutal enforcer for the Winter's Claw, he seeks his end in the great wars to come.--detChampGalio;.-.;Galio;.-.;3;.-.;[Ljava.lang.String;@4de5031f;.-.;the Colossus;.-.;Outside the gleaming city of Demacia, the stone colossus Galio keeps vigilant watch. Built as a bulwark against enemy mages, he often stands motionless for decades until the presence of powerful magic stirs him to life. Once activated, Galio makes the most of his time, savoring the thrill of a fight and the rare honor of defending his countrymen. But his triumphs are always bittersweet, for the magic he destroys is also his source of reanimation, and each victory leaves him dormant once again.--detChampTwisted Fate;.-.;TwistedFate;.-.;4;.-.;[Ljava.lang.String;@67e2d983;.-.;the Card Master;.-.;Twisted Fate is an infamous cardsharp and swindler who has gambled and charmed his way across much of the known world, earning the enmity and admiration of the rich and foolish alike.

In every possible way, Twisted Fate always has an ace up his sleeve.--detChampOrnn;.-.;Ornn;.-.;516;.-.;[Ljava.lang.String;@5d47c63f;.-.;The Fire below the Mountain;.-.;Ornn is the Freljordian spirit of forging and craftsmanship. He works in the solitude of a massive smithy, hammered out from the lava caverns beneath the volcano Hearth-Home.

When other deities\u00e2\u20ac\u201despecially Volibear\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwalk the earth and meddle in mortal affairs, Ornn arises to put these impetuous beings back in their place, either with his trusty hammer or the fiery power of the mountains themselves.--detChampXin Zhao;.-.;XinZhao;.-.;5;.-.;[Ljava.lang.String;@5ea434c8;.-.;the Seneschal of Demacia;.-.;Xin Zhao is a resolute warrior loyal to the ruling Lightshield dynasty. Once condemned to the fighting pits of Noxus, he survived countless gladiatorial bouts, but after being freed by Demacian forces, he swore his life and allegiance to these brave liberators. Armed with his favored three-talon spear, Xin Zhao now fights for his adopted kingdom, audaciously challenging any foe, no matter the odds.--detChampSylas;.-.;Sylas;.-.;517;.-.;[Ljava.lang.String;@3bbc39f8;.-.;the Unshackled;.-.;Raised in one of Demacia's lesser quarters, Sylas of Dregbourne has come to symbolize the darker side of the Great City. As a boy, his ability to root out hidden sorcery caught the attention of the notorious mageseekers, who eventually imprisoned him for turning those same powers against them. Having now broken free, Sylas lives as a hardened revolutionary, using the magic of those around him to destroy the kingdom he once served\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and his band of outcast mage followers seems to grow by the day.--detChampUrgot;.-.;Urgot;.-.;6;.-.;[Ljava.lang.String;@4ae3c1cd;.-.;the Dreadnought;.-.;Once a powerful Noxian headsman, Urgot was betrayed by the empire for which he had killed so many. Bound in iron chains, he was forced to learn the true meaning of strength in the Dredge\u00e2\u20ac\u201da prison mine deep beneath Zaun. Emerging in a disaster that spread chaos throughout the city, he now casts an imposing shadow over its criminal underworld. Raising his victims on the very chains that once enslaved him, he will purge his new home of the unworthy, making it a crucible of pain.--detChampNeeko;.-.;Neeko;.-.;518;.-.;[Ljava.lang.String;@29f69090;.-.;the Curious Chameleon;.-.;Hailing from a long lost tribe of vastaya, Neeko can blend into any crowd by borrowing the appearances of others, even absorbing something of their emotional state to tell friend from foe in an instant. No one is ever sure where\u00e2\u20ac\u201dor who\u00e2\u20ac\u201dNeeko might be, but those who intend to do her harm will soon witness her true colors revealed, and feel the full power of her primordial spirit magic unleashed upon them.--detChampLeBlanc;.-.;Leblanc;.-.;7;.-.;[Ljava.lang.String;@568bf312;.-.;the Deceiver;.-.;Mysterious even to other members of the Black Rose cabal, LeBlanc is but one of many names for a pale woman who has manipulated people and events since the earliest days of Noxus.

Always plotting just out of sight, LeBlanc's true motives are as inscrutable as her shifting identity.--detChampVladimir;.-.;Vladimir;.-.;8;.-.;[Ljava.lang.String;@ca263c2;.-.;the Crimson Reaper;.-.;A fiend with a thirst for mortal blood, Vladimir has influenced the affairs of Noxus since the empire's earliest days. In addition to unnaturally extending his life, his mastery of hemomancy allows him to control the minds and bodies of others as easily as his own. In the flamboyant salons of the Noxian aristocracy, this has enabled him to build a fanatical cult of personality around himself\u00e2\u20ac\u201dwhile in the lowest back alleys, it allows him to bleed his enemies dry.--detChampFiddlesticks;.-.;FiddleSticks;.-.;9;.-.;[Ljava.lang.String;@589b3632;.-.;the Harbinger of Doom;.-.;Fiddlesticks is a ghastly, living scarecrow who stalks the darkness, wielding a cruel scythe and preying upon the unwary. Once a lonely man accused of bringing famine to his village, he was tied up and left to starve in his own barren field.

She and her twin sister Morgana were the protectors of Demacia for many years\u00e2\u20ac\u201duntil Kayle became disillusioned with the repeated failings of mortals, and abandoned this realm altogether. Still, legends are told of her punishing the unjust with her fiery swords, and many hope that she will one day return\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6--detChampAatrox;.-.;Aatrox;.-.;266;.-.;[Ljava.lang.String;@4c6e276e;.-.;the Darkin Blade;.-.;Once honored defenders of Shurima against the Void, Aatrox and his brethren would eventually become an even greater threat to Runeterra, and were defeated only by cunning mortal sorcery. But after centuries of imprisonment, Aatrox was the first to find freedom once more, corrupting and transforming those foolish enough to try and wield the magical weapon that contained his essence. Now, with stolen flesh, he walks Runeterra in a brutal approximation of his previous form, seeking an apocalyptic and long overdue vengeance.--detChampMaster Yi;.-.;MasterYi;.-.;11;.-.;[Ljava.lang.String;@534df152;.-.;the Wuju Bladesman;.-.;Master Yi has tempered his body and sharpened his mind, so that thought and action have become almost as one. Though he chooses to enter into violence only as a last resort, the grace and speed of his blade ensures resolution is always swift. As one of the last living practitioners of the Ionian art of Wuju, Yi has devoted his life to continuing the legacy of his people\u00e2\u20ac\u201dscrutinizing potential new disciples with the Seven Lenses of Insight to identify the most worthy among them.--detChampNami;.-.;Nami;.-.;267;.-.;[Ljava.lang.String;@52e677af;.-.;the Tidecaller;.-.;A headstrong young vastaya of the seas, Nami was the first of the Marai tribe to leave the waves and venture onto dry land, when their ancient accord with the Targonians was broken. With no other option, she took it upon herself to complete the sacred ritual that would ensure the safety of her people. Amidst the chaos of this new age, Nami faces an uncertain future with grit and determination, using her Tidecaller staff to summon the strength of the oceans themselves.--detChampAlistar;.-.;Alistar;.-.;12;.-.;[Ljava.lang.String;@35083305;.-.;the Minotaur;.-.;Always a mighty warrior with a fearsome reputation, Alistar seeks revenge for the death of his clan at the hands of the Noxian empire. Though he was enslaved and forced into the life of a gladiator, his unbreakable will was what kept him from truly becoming a beast. Now, free of the chains of his former masters, he fights in the name of the downtrodden and the disadvantaged, his rage as much a weapon as his horns, hooves and fists.--detChampAzir;.-.;Azir;.-.;268;.-.;[Ljava.lang.String;@8e0379d;.-.;the Emperor of the Sands;.-.;Azir was a mortal emperor of Shurima in a far distant age, a proud man who stood at the cusp of immortality.

With his buried city risen from the sand, Azir seeks to restore Shurima to its former glory.--detChampRyze;.-.;Ryze;.-.;13;.-.;[Ljava.lang.String;@341b80b2;.-.;the Rune Mage;.-.;Widely considered one of the most adept sorcerers on Runeterra, Ryze is an ancient, hard-bitten archmage with an impossibly heavy burden to bear. Armed with immense arcane power and a boundless constitution, he tirelessly hunts for World Runes\u00e2\u20ac\u201dfragments of the raw magic that once shaped the world from nothingness. He must retrieve these artifacts before they fall into the wrong hands, for Ryze understands the horrors they could unleash on Runeterra.--detChampSion;.-.;Sion;.-.;14;.-.;[Ljava.lang.String;@55a1c291;.-.;The Undead Juggernaut;.-.;A war hero from a bygone era, Sion was revered in Noxus for choking the life out of a Demacian king with his bare hands\u00e2\u20ac\u201dbut, denied oblivion, he was resurrected to serve his empire even in death. His indiscriminate slaughter claimed all who stood in his way, regardless of allegiance, proving he no longer retained his former humanity. Even so, with crude armor bolted onto rotten flesh, Sion continues to charge into battle with reckless abandon, struggling to remember his true self between the swings of his mighty axe.--detChampSivir;.-.;Sivir;.-.;15;.-.;[Ljava.lang.String;@2145433b;.-.;the Battle Mistress;.-.;Sivir is a renowned fortune hunter and mercenary captain who plies her trade in the deserts of Shurima.

A yordle with an unwavering sense of morality, he takes pride in following the Bandle Scout's Code, sometimes with such eagerness that he is unaware of the broader consequences of his actions. Though some say the existence of the Scouts is questionable, one thing is for certain\: Teemo's conviction is nothing to be trifled with.--detChampTristana;.-.;Tristana;.-.;18;.-.;[Ljava.lang.String;@1b083826;.-.;the Yordle Gunner;.-.;While many other yordles channel their energy into discovery, invention, or just plain mischief-making, Tristana was always inspired by the adventures of great warriors. She had heard much about Runeterra, its factions, and its wars, and believed her kind could become worthy of legend too. Setting foot in the world for the first time, she took up her trusty cannon Boomer, and now leaps into battle with steadfast courage and optimism.--detChampWarwick;.-.;Warwick;.-.;19;.-.;[Ljava.lang.String;@105fece7;.-.;the Uncaged Wrath of Zaun;.-.;Warwick is a monster who hunts the gray alleys of Zaun. Transformed by agonizing experiments, his body is fused with an intricate system of chambers and pumps, machinery filling his veins with alchemical rage.

None who spill it can escape him.--detChampNunu & Willump;.-.;Nunu;.-.;20;.-.;[Ljava.lang.String;@3ec300f1;.-.;the Boy and His Yeti;.-.;Once upon a time, there was a boy who wanted to prove he was a hero by slaying a fearsome monster\u00e2\u20ac\u201donly to discover that the beast, a lonely and magical yeti, merely needed a friend. Bound together by ancient power and a shared love of snowballs, Nunu and Willump now ramble wildly across the Freljord, breathing life into imagined adventures. They hope that somewhere out there, they will find Nunu's mother. If they can save her, maybe they will be heroes after all\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6--detChampMiss Fortune;.-.;MissFortune;.-.;21;.-.;[Ljava.lang.String;@482cd91f;.-.;the Bounty Hunter;.-.;A Bilgewater captain famed for her looks but feared for her ruthlessness, Sarah Fortune paints a stark figure among the hardened criminals of the port city. As a child, she witnessed the reaver king Gangplank murder her family\u00e2\u20ac\u201dan act she brutally avenged years later, blowing up his flagship while he was still aboard. Those who underestimate her will face a beguiling and unpredictable opponent\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and, likely, a bullet or two in their guts.--detChampAshe;.-.;Ashe;.-.;22;.-.;[Ljava.lang.String;@123f1134;.-.;the Frost Archer;.-.;Iceborn warmother of the Avarosan tribe, Ashe commands the most populous horde in the north. Stoic, intelligent, and idealistic, yet uncomfortable with her role as leader, she taps into the ancestral magics of her lineage to wield a bow of True Ice.

The wrathful barbarian has long sought revenge for the annihilation of his clan, though more recently he has found companionship with Ashe, the Avarosan warmother, and a home with her people. His almost inhuman strength and fortitude is legendary, and has delivered him and his new allies countless victories against the greatest of odds.--detChampJax;.-.;Jax;.-.;24;.-.;[Ljava.lang.String;@5b0abc94;.-.;Grandmaster at Arms;.-.;Unmatched in both his skill with unique armaments and his biting sarcasm, Jax is the last known weapons master of Icathia. After his homeland was laid low by its own hubris in unleashing the Void, Jax and his kind vowed to protect what little remained. As magic now rises in the world, this slumbering threat stirs once more, and Jax roams Valoran, wielding the last light of Icathia and testing all warriors he meets to see if any are strong enough to stand beside him...--detChampMorgana;.-.;Morgana;.-.;25;.-.;[Ljava.lang.String;@75c072cb;.-.;the Fallen;.-.;Conflicted between her celestial and mortal natures, Morgana bound her wings to embrace humanity, and inflicts her pain and bitterness upon the dishonest and the corrupt. She rejects laws and traditions she believes are unjust, and fights for truth from the shadows of Demacia\u00e2\u20ac\u201deven as others seek to repress it\u00e2\u20ac\u201dby casting shields and chains of dark fire. More than anything else, Morgana truly believes that even the banished and outcast may one day rise again.--detChampZilean;.-.;Zilean;.-.;26;.-.;[Ljava.lang.String;@1f1c7bf6;.-.;the Chronokeeper;.-.;Once a powerful Icathian mage, Zilean became obsessed with the passage of time after witnessing his homeland's destruction by the Void.

His concoctions rarely fail, but it appears to many that Singed has lost all sense of humanity, leaving a toxic trail of misery and terror in his wake.--detChampEvelynn;.-.;Evelynn;.-.;28;.-.;[Ljava.lang.String;@2b546384;.-.;Agony's Embrace;.-.;Within the dark seams of Runeterra, the demon Evelynn searches for her next victim. She lures in prey with the voluptuous fa\u00c3\u00a7ade of a human female, but once a person succumbs to her charms, Evelynn's true form is unleashed. She then subjects her victim to unspeakable torment, gratifying herself with their pain. To the demon, these liaisons are innocent flings. To the rest of Runeterra, they are ghoulish tales of lust gone awry and horrific reminders of the cost of wanton desire.--detChampTwitch;.-.;Twitch;.-.;29;.-.;[Ljava.lang.String;@5d740a0f;.-.;the Plague Rat;.-.;A Zaunite plague rat by birth, but a connoisseur of filth by passion, Twitch is not afraid to get his paws dirty. Aiming a chem-powered crossbow at the gilded heart of Piltover, he has vowed to show those in the city above just how filthy they really are. Always a sneaky sneak, when he's not rooting around in the Sump, he's digging deep into other people's garbage for discarded treasures\u00e2\u20ac\u00a6 and perhaps a moldy sandwich.--detChampKarthus;.-.;Karthus;.-.;30;.-.;[Ljava.lang.String;@214b199c;.-.;the Deathsinger;.-.;The harbinger of oblivion, Karthus is an undying spirit whose haunting songs are a prelude to the horror of his nightmarish appearance.

A perfect expression of the Void's desire to consume all life, Cho'Gath's complex biology quickly converts matter into new bodily growth\u00e2\u20ac\u201dincreasing its muscle mass and density, or hardening its outer carapace like organic diamond.

Protected by a spiked shell, he inspires increasingly disparate theories on his origin wherever he goes\u00e2\u20ac\u201dfrom demigod, to sacred oracle, to a mere beast transformed by magic. Whatever the truth may be, Rammus keeps his own counsel and stops for no one as he roams the Shuriman desert.--detChampAnivia;.-.;Anivia;.-.;34;.-.;[Ljava.lang.String;@2c34f934;.-.;the Cryophoenix;.-.;Anivia is a benevolent winged spirit who endures endless cycles of life, death, and rebirth to protect the Freljord. A demigod born of unforgiving ice and bitter winds, she wields those elemental powers to thwart any who dare disturb her homeland.

She fights with every ounce of her being, knowing that through her sacrifice, her memory will endure, and she will be reborn into a new tomorrow.--detChampShaco;.-.;Shaco;.-.;35;.-.;[Ljava.lang.String;@12d3a4e9;.-.;the Demon Jester;.-.;Crafted long ago as a plaything for a lonely prince, the enchanted marionette Shaco now delights in murder and mayhem. Corrupted by dark magic and the loss of his beloved charge, the once-kind puppet finds pleasure only in the misery of the poor souls he torments. He uses toys and simple tricks to deadly effect, finding the results of his bloody \u00e2\u20ac\u0153games\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd hilarious\u00e2\u20ac\u201dand for those who hear a dark chuckle in the dead of night, the Demon Jester may have marked them as his next plaything.--detChampDr. Mundo;.-.;DrMundo;.-.;36;.-.;[Ljava.lang.String;@240237d2;.-.;the Madman of Zaun;.-.;Utterly insane, unrepentantly homicidal, and horrifyingly purple, Dr. Mundo is what keeps many of Zaun's citizens indoors on particularly dark nights. This monosyllabic monstrosity seems to want nothing more than pain\u00e2\u20ac\u201dboth the giving of it, and the receiving of it. Wielding his massive meat cleaver as if it were weightless, Mundo is infamous for capturing and torturing dozens of Zaun's citizens for his nefarious \u00e2\u20ac\u0153operations,\u00e2\u20ac\ufffd which seem to have no overall point or goal. He is brutal. He is unpredictable. He goes where he pleases. He is also not, technically, a doctor.--detChampSona;.-.;Sona;.-.;37;.-.;[Ljava.lang.String;@25a65b77;.-.;Maven of the Strings;.-.;Sona is Demacia's foremost virtuoso of the stringed etwahl, speaking only through her graceful chords and vibrant arias. This genteel manner has endeared her to the highborn, though others suspect her spellbinding melodies to actually emanate magic\u00e2\u20ac\u201da Demacian taboo. Silent to outsiders but somehow understood by close companions, Sona plucks her harmonies not only to soothe injured allies, but also to strike down unsuspecting enemies.--detChampKassadin;.-.;Kassadin;.-.;38;.-.;[Ljava.lang.String;@2ed0fbae;.-.;the Void Walker;.-.;Cutting a burning swath through the darkest places of the world, Kassadin knows his days are numbered.

Her favor and protection has since been called into the depths of Zaun, where Janna has become a beacon of hope to those in need. No one knows where or when she will appear, but more often than not, she's come to help.--detChampGangplank;.-.;Gangplank;.-.;41;.-.;[Ljava.lang.String;@3c87521;.-.;the Saltwater Scourge;.-.;As unpredictable as he is brutal, the dethroned reaver king Gangplank is feared far and wide.
